LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported Â£20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him.
"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs."
Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch.
There is life beyond Potter, however.
So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail.
